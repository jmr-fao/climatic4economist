The first approach is to use absolute threshold and the second is to use relative threshold to define weather extreme. In this tutorial we will calculate both approaches. For the relative thresholds, it is common practice to use the percentile of the weather distribution. \n\n>These percentiles were already computed in another tutorial so we directly load them. Similarly, we already extracted the weather observation based on the villages coordinates in the same tutorial, so we directly load them as well.\n\n\n## Code\n### Set Up\n\nIn the setup, we create the paths to the various data sources and load the necessary functions for extraction. Note `..` means one step back to the folder directory, i.e. one folder back.\n\n```{r set_up}\n#| label: set_up\n\npath_to_data <- file.path(\"..\",\n                          \"..\", \"data\")\npath_to_tmp_min <- file.path(path_to_data, \"weather\", \"ERA5_Land\", \"AFG\", \n                             \"daily\",\n                             \"day_50_25_2m_tmp_min_village.rds\")\npath_to_tmp_min_percentile <- file.path(path_to_data, \"weather\", \"ERA5_Land\", \"AFG\", \n                         \"percentile\",  \"pct_80_25_2m_tmp_min_village.rds\")\n\npath_to_cold_indices <- file.path(path_to_data, \"result\", \"afg_village_cold_ind_2024_09.dta\")\n```\n\n```{r package}\n#| label: package\n\nlibrary(climatic4economist)\n```\n\n### Load the data\nLet's start by loading the data into R. We load the weather observations with the function `readRDS()` as file as saved as `rds` format.\n\nWe notice that both datasets have some variables in common: `ID`, `Province`, `District`, `Village`.\n\nThe weather data is in wide format, where each column represent a date of observation.\n\nThe percentile data has other variables, one is `month` as the percentiles are calculated separately for each month. Then we have `day_1p`, `day_5p`, and `day_10p` which are respectively the first, the fifth, and the 10th percentiles.\n\n```{r read_weather}\n#| label: read_weather\n\ntmp_min_vllg <- readRDS(path_to_tmp_min)|>\n  dplyr::as_tibble()\ntmp_min_vllg\n\ntmp_min_pct <- readRDS(path_to_tmp_min_percentile) |>\n  dplyr::as_tibble() |> \n  dplyr::mutate(month = as.character(month))\ntmp_min_pct\n```\n\n### Find absolute extreme days\nWe are not interested finding the weather extremes event along all the time series but just in the last years before the survey. We select the relevant years with the function `select_by_dates()`.\n\n```{r select_dates}\n#| label: select_dates\n\ntmp_min_vllg_23 <- select_by_dates(tmp_min_vllg, \n                                  from = \"2023-01-01\", to = \"2024-12-31\")\ntmp_min_vllg_23\n```\n\nTo find the weather extreme events we use the functions `find_extr_abs_day()` and `find_spell()`, respectively to find cold days and cold spell. We choose the extreme temperature with the `l_thresh` argument in the `find_extr_abs_day()` function.\n\nThe first columns are the unique `ID`s of the locations and the dates of observation. Then column `value` refers to the actual weather observation. After we have the extreme events. The columns that starts with `day` tell us if that day the temperature was below the threshold we indicated. The columns that start with `celsius` tells by how many degree the temperature was below the threshold. Note the name depends on the optional argument `unit`. When these columns are zero, it means that day the temperature was above the threshold.\n\n```{r find_abs_extr_day}\n#| label: find_abs_extr_day\n\ncold_day_abs <- find_extr_abs_day(tmp_min_vllg_23,\n                                  l_thresh = c(0, -15, -20),\n                                  unit = \"celsius\")\ncold_day_abs\n```\n\nThe function `find_spell()` just need the extreme days calculated before to check how many time they are consecutive. Similar the result for the extreme spell has the unique `ID`s of the locations, the dates, and the actual weather observation. The rest of the columns tell us the consecutive days that the temperature was below the threshold. Specifically, it tells us this when the spell is over and its length. `NA` values refer to days with temperature above the threshold or days where the spell is not over yet. By default the function look for at least two consecutive days, you can change this behavior with the argument `min_spell`. For example, by setting `min_spell = 5` you need at least five consecutive days below the threshold.\n\n```{r find_abs_extr_spell}\n#| label: find_abs_extr_spell\n\ncold_spell_abs <- find_spell(cold_day_abs)\ncold_spell_abs\n```\n\n### Find relative extreme days\nIf we want use the percentiles as extreme threshold we can use the `find_rel_extr_day()` function to look for extreme weather observation.\n\nThe function requires the weather observations and the relative thresholds we want to use. Additionally we can provide also the unit of measure with the argument `unit`. This has no computational implication but it labels the result accordingly.\n\nBesides the `ID` unique identifier, the date and the weather observation, the function returns two set of variables. \n\n* The variables that start with `day_blw_` tells us if that day the temperature was below the monthly percentile indicated by the number.\n* The variables that start with `celsius_blw_` tells us by how many degree the daily temperature exceeded the monthly percentile indicated by the number.\n\nThe variables that contain `_min_` tells us if that day the temperature was below the lowest among the monthly percentiles. This means that the percentile is not specific for the month but it is the lowest of the year. In other words, it doesn't take into consideration seasonality but always compare with the extreme of the month with coldest temperature. This is useful if we want to consider an implicit upper bound for temperature. For example, in places with strong seasonality, with cold winter and hot summer, even relatively child temperature can be considered extreme in summer.\n\n```{r find_rel_ext_day}\n#| label: find_rel_ext_day\n\ncold_day_rel <- find_extr_rel_day(tmp_min_vllg_23,\n                                  l_thresh = tmp_min_pct,\n                                  unit = \"celsius\")\ncold_day_rel\n```\n\nWe can calculate the cold spells, again using the function `find_spell()`. This time the argument are the extreme days calculated with the relative thresholds.\n\nThe result tells us by how many days the cold spell exceeded the monthly percentile length indicated by the number. Days with `NA` values are days without any ending cold spell exceeding the thresholds. A value of zero means that the spell exactly matches the thresholds.\n\n```{r find_extr_rel_spell}\n#| label: find_extr_rel_spell\n\ncold_spell_rel <- find_spell(cold_day_rel)\ncold_spell_rel\n```\n\nTo better check the result let's \"zoom\" on actual spells. We can see that there are some cold spells.\n\nWhy do we have a cold spell with the first percentile and not for the other? Because the first percentile is more stringent than the other so it is likely that the spell is shorter, and since the result reports the length in the last day of the spell, there is no matching among the spell calculated with different thresholds.\n\n```{r spell_focus}\n#| label: spell_focus\ncold_spell_rel |> \n  dplyr::filter(spell_blw_1p > 0)\n```\n\nWe also notice how a value of 5.95 degree Celsius is still associated with a cold spell. This because the observation happened in August and a temperature of 5.95 is considered relatively very cold for that month, below the first percentile of the distribution. However, it is not absolutely an extreme cold temperature. To balance relative and absolute temperature it is possible to set an upper bound in the calculation of the percentiles. Check the argument `u_thresh` in the function `calc_pct_day()`, you can do it by writing `?calc_pct_day` in the console.\n\n### Compute the extreme weather indicator\nSo far we have the full time series with the extreme events, however for the microeconomics applications we need to summarize this information into some indicators. We can achieve this using the function `extr_day_index()` and `extr_spell_index()`, respectively for summarizing the extreme days and the spell of extreme days.\n\nBoth functions require the data with the extreme observations, the column name with the date of interview, the column name that uniquely identify the unit of observation, a time interval over which summarize the extreme observations, and the number of lags. Let's proceed with order.\n\n* `df`, the extreme weather observations.\n* `interview`, column name with the date of interview. This is important as we don't want to assign weather observation that happened after the household/individual interview. The interviews represent the reference date for the period of analysis. In some situation, we don't have a precise date of interview, but we still need to provide a date for the aggregation. This alternative date can be anyone, like the last date of available observations, or the last day of the year, or a custom date based on a precise calendar season.\n* `id`, column name that uniquely identify the unit of observation. This might be different form the ones we have been using so far. The column `ID` and `ID_adm_div` were appositely created to identify the unique locations. The new column `id` refers to the actual unit of the survey. The distinction is important as the different unit, even if interviewed in the same place, the date of interview can be different and hence the reference period for the summarizing of the extreme weather.\n* `interval`, starting form the date of interview how back in time should the function look for the extreme weather events. This argument must be a character like `\"1 year\"` if we want to summarize the year before the date of interview, or `\"6 months\"` if we want to summarize the last six months before the interview. Of course, `\"1 year\"`, `\"12 months\"` and `\"365 days\"` are all equivalent.\n* The `interval` and the date of interview define the reference period but we can have more than one reference period by going back in time. The `n_lags` argument controls for how many reference periods the function summarizes the weather extreme. This argument is optional and the default value is zero, i.e. just the first reference period.\n\n```{r extr_index}\n#| label: extr_spell_index\ncold_abs_index <- extr_day_index(cold_day_abs, \n                                 interview = \"2024-09-01\",\n                                 id = ID,\n                                 interval = \"1 year\",\n                                 n_lags = 0)\ncold_abs_index\n\ncold_spell_abs_index <- extr_spell_index(cold_spell_abs,\n                                         interview = \"2024-09-01\",\n                                         id = ID,\n                                         interval = \"1 year\")\ncold_spell_abs_index\n\ncold_rel_index <- extr_day_index(cold_day_rel, \n                                 interview = \"2024-09-01\",\n                                 id = ID,\n                                 interval = \"1 year\")\ncold_rel_index\n\ncold_spell_rel_index <- extr_spell_index(cold_spell_rel,\n                                         interview = \"2024-09-01\",\n                                         id = ID,\n                                         interval = \"1 year\")\ncold_spell_rel_index\n\n```\n\n### Merge with survey\n\nNow, we combine the extracted weather data with the village data using `merge_with_survey()`, which under the hood uses the variable `ID` as the key matching variable.\n\n```{r merge_tmin_pct}\n#| label: merge_tmin_pct\n\ncold_day_abs_vllg <- merge_with_survey(tmp_min_vllg, cold_abs_index) \ncold_day_abs_vllg\n\ncold_spell_abs_vllg <- merge_with_survey(tmp_min_vllg, cold_spell_abs_index)\ncold_spell_abs_vllg\n\ncold_day_rel_vllg <- merge_with_survey(tmp_min_vllg, cold_rel_index)\ncold_day_rel_vllg\n\ncold_spell_rel_vllg <- merge_with_survey(tmp_min_vllg, cold_spell_rel_index)\ncold_spell_rel_vllg\n```\n\n### Write\nNow that we have the cold spell indices we can save the results as `dta` using the `haven::write_dta()` function. To avoid having too many datasets, we first merge all the different indicators, using `purrr::reduce()` and `merge_by_common()` functions. Then we adapt the name to be aligned with the STATA format, we delate the fifth column as the name cannot be aligned with the STATA format, and finally we save the result.\n\n```{r write}\n#| label: write\n\nlist(cold_day_abs_vllg, cold_spell_abs_vllg, cold_day_rel_vllg, cold_spell_rel_vllg) |>\n  purrr::reduce(merge_by_common) |>\n  dplyr::rename_with(to_stata_format) |>\n  dplyr::select(-5) |> \n  haven::write_dta(path_to_cold_indices)\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Intro\nThe goal of this tutorial is to guide the user to calculate extreme weather indicator for cold temperature.\nThere are two main approaches to do so.

This argument is optional and the default value is zero, i.e. just the first reference period.\n\n```{r extr_index}\n#| label: extr_spell_index\ncold_abs_index <- extr_day_index(cold_day_abs, \n                                 interview = \"2024-09-01\",\n                                 id = ID,\n                                 interval = \"1 year\",\n                                 n_lags = 0)\ncold_abs_index\n\ncold_spell_abs_index <- extr_spell_index(cold_spell_abs,\n                                         interview = \"2024-09-01\",\n                                         id = ID,\n                                         interval = \"1 year\")\ncold_spell_abs_index\n\ncold_rel_index <- extr_day_index(cold_day_rel, \n                                 interview = \"2024-09-01\",\n                                 id = ID,\n                                 interval = \"1 year\")\ncold_rel_index\n\ncold_spell_rel_index <- extr_spell_index(cold_spell_rel,\n                                         interview = \"2024-09-01\",\n                                         id = ID,\n                                         interval = \"1 year\")\ncold_spell_rel_index\n\n```\n\n### Merge with survey\n\nNow, we combine the extracted weather data with the village data using `merge_with_survey()`, which under the hood uses the variable `ID` as the key matching variable.\n\n```{r merge_tmin_pct}\n#| label: merge_tmin_pct\n\ncold_day_abs_vllg <- merge_with_survey(tmp_min_vllg, cold_abs_index) \ncold_day_abs_vllg\n\ncold_spell_abs_vllg <- merge_with_survey(tmp_min_vllg, cold_spell_abs_index)\ncold_spell_abs_vllg\n\ncold_day_rel_vllg <- merge_with_survey(tmp_min_vllg, cold_rel_index)\ncold_day_rel_vllg\n\ncold_spell_rel_vllg <- merge_with_survey(tmp_min_vllg, cold_spell_rel_index)\ncold_spell_rel_vllg\n```\n\n### Write\nNow that we have the cold spell indices we can save the results as `dta` using the `haven::write_dta()` function. To avoid having too many datasets, we first merge all the different indicators, using `purrr::reduce()` and `merge_by_common()` functions. Then we adapt the name to be aligned with the STATA format, we delate the fifth column as the name cannot be aligned with the STATA format, and finally we save the result.\n\n```{r write}\n#| label:
