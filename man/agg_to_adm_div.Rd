\title{Aggregate Data to Administrative Divisions}
\usage{
agg_to_adm_div(df, match_col, extra_col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing extreme event indicators, administrative division IDs,
and coverage fractions.}
}
\value{
A data frame grouped by administrative division (\code{ID_adm_div}) and \code{date},
with aggregated values for daily (\verb{^day}) and spell (\verb{^spell}) indicators.
}
\description{
This function aggregates daily and spell-based extreme event indicators to the level
of administrative divisions using a weighted mean, where weights are based on the
\code{coverage_fraction} of each observation.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(
  ID_adm_div = c(1, 1, 2, 2),
  date = as.Date(c("2024-01-01", "2024-01-01", "2024-01-02", "2024-01-02")),
  day_abv_90p = c(5, 10, 2, 8),
  spell_abv_90p = c(2, 3, 1, 2),
  coverage_fraction = c(0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.3)
