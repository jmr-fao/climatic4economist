\description{
This function filters rows in a data frame based on interview dates, which
are provided as a column in the data frame. The user can specify a time
interval in years or months, and the data will be filtered based on whether
the interview dates fall within the given period. Missing interview data can
either be dropped or retained.

\examples{
# Example data frame with interview dates
df <- data.frame(id = 1:5,
                 date = as.Date(c('2022-01-01', '2022-02-01',
                  '2022-03-01', NA, '2022-05-01')),
                 value = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))
